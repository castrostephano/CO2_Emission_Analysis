# CO2_Emission_Analysis

This project was created using data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koustavghosh149/co2-emission-around-the-world/data

Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib are the libraries used in this project

First analysis includes three charts that show the top ten countries in the world with the highest CO2 emissions per capita in 2000,2010 and 2019

Second analysis includes two charts that show a box plot with the CO2 emissions data for the seven different regions

Then the melt function is used to transform the table in order to create a date column and carbon value column 

Those two columns were made to create this chloropleth map that shows world wide carbon emissions in:
