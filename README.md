# CO2_Emission_Analysis

This python project was created using data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koustavghosh149/co2-emission-around-the-world/data

The python libraries Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib are used in this project

First analysis includes three charts that show the top ten countries in the world with the highest CO2 emissions per capita in 2000,2010 and 2019

Second analysis includes two statistical summary charts that show a box plot with the CO2 emissions data for the seven different regions in 2010 and 2019.

Then the melt function is used to transform, or pivot, the table in order to create a new dataframe with a date column and carbon value column 

They were used to create the chloropleth map below that shows world wide carbon emissions in:
